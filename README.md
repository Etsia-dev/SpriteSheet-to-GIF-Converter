# SpriteSheet to GIF Converter

A simple Python program that converts **horizontal sprite sheets** into animated GIFs using Python, Pillow, and Tkinter. This project is intended **for learning purposes only** (or you can use it fi you want to) and demonstrates my simple abilities in basic GUI development, image processing, and animation in Python.

## Features
- Supports **horizontal sprite sheets only** (sprites arranged side by side).
- Generates animated GIFs automatically from sprite sheets.
- Displays generated GIFs in a grid preview within a Tkinter GUI.
- Allows browsing `.png` files from a specified folder.
- Saves output GIFs to an `output gifs` folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place your horizontal sprite sheets in the `input images` folder.
3. Run the script :)
